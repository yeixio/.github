## Reporting a vulnerability

If you believe you’ve found a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a public GitHub issue.**
2. Email us at: security@yeix.io (or another preferred address)
3. Provide as much detail as possible:
   - Affected project / URL
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Impact (what could an attacker do?)
   - Any proof-of-concept exploit

We’ll aim to:

- Acknowledge your report within **5 business days**.
- Provide a timeline for investigation and remediation, where possible.
- Keep you updated on progress.

## Scope

This policy applies to Yeix.io-maintained repositories and deployed services. Third-party dependencies are generally out of scope, but reports are still appreciated if they affect our deployments.

## Responsible disclosure

Please avoid:

- Privacy violations
- Destroying or modifying data
- Service disruptions

We ask that you give us a reasonable chance to remediate before public disclosure.
