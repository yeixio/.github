# Code of Conduct

We want Yeix.io projects to be a welcoming, professional place to collaborate.

- Be respectful and constructive.
- Assume good intent, but listen when impact is raised.
- No harassment, personal attacks, or discriminatory language.
- Keep reviews about the code, not the person.
- Respect privacy and confidentiality.

If you experience or witness behavior that violates this code:

- For public repos, you may contact a maintainer privately (via GitHub or the contact link on https://yeix.io).
- For serious concerns, mention that it is a Code of Conduct issue in your message so we can prioritize it.

Maintainers may take actions including discussion, warnings, restricting participation, or blocking accounts for repeated or severe violations.
