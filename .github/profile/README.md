## How we work

- **Default branch:** `main`  
- **Flow:** feature branches → pull requests → review → merge  
- **Infra:** Heavy use of Go, TypeScript/React, Kubernetes, and cloud-native tooling  
- **Project management:** Lightweight Agile/Kanban, small batch changes, frequent releases

If you’re browsing:

- Look for `README.md` and `docs/` in each repo for project-specific info.
- Open or search issues with labels like `good first issue` or `help wanted` if you want to contribute.
